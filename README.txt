TestPerformance.java

	State how many times the tests were executed for each SIZE (10, 100, 1000 and 10000)
	to get the running time in milliseconds and how the test running times were recorded.
	These are examples of SIZEs you might choose, you can choose others if you wish.

	SIZE 10
								  #1   #2   #3   #4   #5   #6 	... (as many tests as you ran)
        testArrayListAddRemove:  val1 val2 val3 val4 val5 val6  ... (fill these in in ms)
        testLinkedListAddRemove: val1 val2 val3 val4 val5 val6
		testArrayListAccess:     val1 val2 val3 val4 val5 val6
        testLinkedListAccess:    val1 val2 val3 val4 val5 val6
